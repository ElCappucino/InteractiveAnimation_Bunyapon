This is my interactive animation project made during my Advance Computer Graphic class

The project mainly focus on
1. create a terrain mesh using diamond-square algorithm
2. Making an animation using cube and also use it as a light sources

the appearance doesn't really look complete, but i learn more and more about the gist of openGL pipeline and how the algorithm works.
